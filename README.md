# Inventory Management System  
Software Engineering 3 – Year 3 Project

## Project Overview
This project is a Java based Inventory Management System which we done for the Software Engineering 3 module.  
It is designed for a clothing store to manage inventory, suppliers, sales, returns, and reporting etc.

The system will show all the software engineering principles including MVC architecture, Agile development, testing, metrics, CI/CD, and quality management.
